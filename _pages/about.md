Welcome to my homepage! I am a Ph.D. candidate at [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.uh.edu), University of Houston, Texas. I earned my Bachelor of Science in Applied Mathematics from [Hanoi University of Science and Technology](https://hust.edu.vn/).

Working at *Quantitative Imaging Lab* under the supervision of Professor [Shishir Shah](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gJ3JGSsAAAAJ&hl=en), my research focuses on **Computer Vision and Deep Learning**. I am working actively on [Person Re-Identification](https://paperswithcode.com/task/person-re-identification#:~:text=It%20involves%20detecting%20and%20tracking,a%20robust%20and%20efficient%20manner.), where I develop feature extraction models to re-identify persons of interest, serving surveillance and public safety purposes. Besides, I am interested in working on **3D Reconstruction** and **Data Quality Assessment**.
